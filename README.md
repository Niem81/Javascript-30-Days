- Using e.preventDefault() stops the page from reloading. By default, using a form will reload the page after sending the data
- localStorage may seem like an Object but it is simply a key value store and you may only use strings in local storage
- As localStorage can only handle strings, we need to stringify the data before sending it like an object.

16. Text Shadow on Mouse Move
- offsetTop: returns the top position (in pixels) relative to the top of the offsetParent element. It includes: top position and margin of elmnt; top padding, scrollbar, and border of the offsetParent element
- offsetLeft: same as offsetTop it returns the left position relative to left side the offsetParent element.
